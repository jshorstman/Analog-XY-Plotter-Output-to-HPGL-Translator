# Analog-XY-Plotter-Output-to-HPGL-Translator
The Translator will continually sample the X and Y analog voltages from an oscilloscope's pen plotter output port, digitize them, and package the values into a series of plain text HP-GL plotter commands, which are output via a USB port to a file on a PC. The HP-GL file can be processed into a display image by any commonly available plotter emulator application, such as PrintCapture (http://www.printcapture.com).<BR>
